# SunScan: Solar Potential Assessment for Residential Rooftops
The project's goal is to assess solar potential for residential buildings by using 2D satellite photos of rooftops. It is currently in development. The study, which uses traditional computer vision techniques, contains critical elements such as roof edge detection, plane orientation, and plane contact connection to determine solar viability. While neural networks will be used in subsequent rounds, emphasizing classical approaches assures a thorough grasp of the issue domain.
