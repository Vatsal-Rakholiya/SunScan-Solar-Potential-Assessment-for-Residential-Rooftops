# SunScan: Solar Potential Assessment for Residential Rooftops
The "Solar Roof" project aims to evaluate solar potential for residential properties using 2D satellite images of rooftops. Currently in development, this project serves as the focus of my master's thesis. Employing conventional computer vision techniques, the analysis includes crucial factors like roof edge detection, plane orientation, and plane contact relation to assess solar viability. While neural networks will be integrated in future iterations, prioritizing traditional methodologies ensures a comprehensive understanding of the problem domain.
